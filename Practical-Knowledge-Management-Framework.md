# Practical Knowledge Management Framework for Real-World Teams

## 1. Start with Use Cases, Not Categories
Forget taxonomies and ontologies—at least at the start. Identify high-impact use cases like:
- “New engineer onboarding takes too long.”
- “Sales needs quick answers to technical objections.”
- “We lose context every time a team member leaves.”

## 2. Use What You Already Have
Map your current knowledge ecosystem (Slack, Drive, Notion, Jira). Normalize naming, versioning, and sharing practices.

## 3. Narrate Your Work
Capture decisions and context in real time:
- Async updates
- Weekly summaries
- Living docs

## 4. Build Knowledge Stewards, Not Gatekeepers
Assign rotating stewards to keep documentation relevant and curated.

## 5. Automate Context Capture, Not Curation
Use automation for:
- Thread summaries
- Meeting recaps
- Auto-archiving content

## 6. Create a “What to Know, Where to Go” Index
Use one living “Start Here” document with key links, updated regularly.

## 7. Measure Adoption, Not Access
Interview users. Send simple surveys. Track duplicated questions and rework.

## 8. Prioritize Clarity Over Completeness
Favor how-tos and short explainers over exhaustive manuals.

## 9. Make It Reusable by Design
Use templates and modular formats like cloneable Notion pages.

## 10. KM Is a Behavior, Not a Platform
Instill habits like:
- Share before asking
- Document while doing
- Improve as you reuse
