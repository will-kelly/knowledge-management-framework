# The Practical Knowledge Management Playbook

## Overview
A no-nonsense approach to KM for real teams working in cloud, AI, and DevOps.

## 🎯 Goals
- Make KM useful on day one
- Reduce tribal knowledge bottlenecks
- Capture and reuse insights continuously

---

## 🔹 Framework Steps

### 1. Start with Use Cases
Identify 3–5 high-impact scenarios (onboarding, sales support, retaining context).

### 2. Use What You Already Have
Stick to tools already in play. Normalize habits over introducing new platforms.

### 3. Narrate Your Work
Encourage:
- Async updates
- “What I learned” posts
- Decision logs

### 4. Appoint Knowledge Stewards
Rotate ownership across teams to keep things fresh and decentralized.

### 5. Automate Context Capture
Let AI and workflow tools summarize, tag, and archive on your behalf.

### 6. Create a “What to Know, Where to Go” Index
Maintain one doc with links to everything important.

### 7. Measure Adoption
Ask users what’s helpful. Track repeated questions and updates needed.

### 8. Prioritize Clarity
Write plainly. Use bullets and templates to scale simplicity.

### 9. Design for Reuse
Build templates and modular components for cloning and repurposing.

### 10. Make KM a Behavior
Hardcode knowledge sharing into how teams work—not just where they store files.
